As promised, I'm going to treat this like normal.

<a name="p07cr0201-code"></a>Code
=================================
This is the code as was submitted.

{% highlight python linenos %}
from random import randrange

#Still To Do:
#1) checkForPosAndRight until done
#2) checkForRightWrongPos until created (and solved)
#3) Iterate through
#4) Do guesses Remaining 
#5) End Game condition

def main():
#takes the random number and assigns it to chosenNum
    chosenNum = setNumber()
    print(chosenNum)
    #takes the chosen number and passes it to the getGuess function
    usrGuess = getGuess(chosenNum)
    numberList = numToList(chosenNum)

def setNumber():
    #picks a random number between 0 and 9999
    number = randrange(0, 9999)
    #sets the number to a string
    ret = str(number)
    #returns the string & if < 4 will add 0 to the front until it is 4 
    return ret.zfill(4)

def getGuess(chosenNum):
    #gets the user guess
    
    usrGuess = input("Enter a Guess: ")
    #checks for win upon guess
    if chosenNum == usrGuess:
        print("You WIN!")
        print("The correct answer was: ", chosenNum)
        
    return usrGuess
    
# function that will take the chosen number
# and returns it as a list
def numToList(chosenNum):
    numAsList = []
    for cha in chosenNum
        numAsList.append(cha)
    
    return numAsList
    
def checkForPosAndRight(usrGuess, numberList):
    #need to create this still
    for index in range(len(numberList))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Main
====

Rather than address your code in the order it's written, I'm going to address it in the order that it appears in your `main` function.

Lines 10 to 16.

{% highlight python %}
def main():
#takes the random number and assigns it to chosenNum
    chosenNum = setNumber()
    print(chosenNum)
    #takes the chosen number and passes it to the getGuess function
    usrGuess = getGuess(chosenNum)
    numberList = numToList(chosenNum)
{% endhighlight %}

Fix your indent on line 11 before I chuck your interpreter in the garbage. You're past the point of needing reminders to indent after a colon. That includes comments.

{% highlight python %}
def main():
    #takes the random number and assigns it to chosenNum
    chosenNum = setNumber()
    print(chosenNum)
    #takes the chosen number and passes it to the getGuess function
    usrGuess = getGuess(chosenNum)
    numberList = numToList(chosenNum)
{% endhighlight %}

We'll revisit the rest of `main` after.

setNumber
=========

Lines 18 - 24

{% highlight python %}
def setNumber():
    #picks a random number between 0 and 9999
    number = randrange(0, 9999)
    #sets the number to a string
    ret = str(number)
    #returns the string & if < 4 will add 0 to the front until it is 4 
    return ret.zfill(4)
{% endhighlight %}

There's really no much to comment on here. What you've remarked on is correct.The algorithm itself seems correct.

Line 20: 

{% highlight python %}
    number = randrange(0, 9999)
{% endhighlight %}

Off by one error that might be my fault (I think we discussed this and I said you'd have to check, but either way, just worry about the knowledge part of things more than the blame :D ) --> `range` is `(start, end)` for `end-1`. Thus:

{% highlight text %}
>>> for x in range(0, 9):
...     print(f"{x}")
...
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
{% endhighlight %}

`randrange` follows the same conventions as `range`. I suspect you meant to write `number = randrange(0, 10000)`. (And default start is zero, if you wanted to omit it.)

Off-by-one errors are quite common. You're going to get used to going "derp" all the time spotting them. If that's the worst thing you do, you're doing okay.

getGuess
========

Lines 26-35

{% highlight python %}
def getGuess(chosenNum):
    #gets the user guess
    
    usrGuess = input("Enter a Guess: ")
    #checks for win upon guess
    if chosenNum == usrGuess:
        print("You WIN!")
        print("The correct answer was: ", chosenNum)
        
    return usrGuess
{% endhighlight %}

Ruh roh, Raggy. This isn't a good idea for a way to do this.

I'm guessing you intend to take the usrGuess and do stuff later with it. Here's the real question - how complex do you plan on making this hop around for checking for win, checking for cows and bulls, and what have you?

Instead of doing that, only get the user guess. Do stateful handling in your main body.

Consider:

{% highlight python %}
def getGuess():
    #gets the user guess
    
    usrGuess = input("Enter a Guess: ")
        
    return usrGuess
{% endhighlight %}

And refactor main:

{% highlight python %}
def main():
    #takes the random number and assigns it to chosenNum
    chosenNum = setNumber()
    print(chosenNum)

    # get user's guess
    usrGuess = getGuess()

    #checks for win upon guess
    if (chosenNum == usrGuess):
        print("You WIN!")
        print("The correct answer was: ", chosenNum)

    numberList = numToList(chosenNum)
{% endhighlight %}

We'll come back to this. I'm sure I've mseed up your intentions but one thing at a time.

numToList
=========

Lines 39 to 44

{% highlight python %}
def numToList(chosenNum):
    numAsList = []
    for cha in chosenNum
        numAsList.append(cha)
    
    return numAsList
{% endhighlight %}

Here you've made a very common early mistake. You learn one method that works and you stick to what you know instead of thinking about what's available to you. You reach for the familiar instead of the brilliant. If I could make one demand of any student, it's this: ***BE BRILLIANT***. Be so brilliant as to make me ashamed of what little I know.

You don't need to break the numbers into a list. The reason for this is that you don't need to assign to that list, ever.

In the *Hangman* problem, the central issue of why it couldn't be done with what you know is that you needed a version of a string that you could change, and tools to work with that. This arose because what I tried to have you do - the expected solution in most languages - doesn't work in Python.

In this problem... you never need to assign to the strings for the user's guess or the actual target combination. You can just read straight from the strings for each.

Consider factoring this out entirely and just reading from the strings. Don't make your life harder than it needs to be.

String is a sequential data type. You can just use a string. You don't need to write to it. If you needed to write to it, it'd be different.

checkForPosAndRight
===================

Yeah, I'm obligated to review even incomplete code.

Lines 46 to 48:

{% highlight python %}
def checkForPosAndRight(usrGuess, numberList):
    #need to create this still
    for index in range(len(numberList))
{% endhighlight %}

If you're using a string, this will require a refactor (numberList would just be the number you're targetting). Otherwise, right track.

I want to give you a small thumbs up for line 48, which inspires some hope for the future. If I'm Severus Snape, that's stealing notes from the Half-Blood Prince's notebook.

Altogether now, and main
========================

The changes I've suggested end up somewhere like this.

{% highlight python %}
from random import randrange

#Still To Do:
#1) checkForPosAndRight until done
#2) checkForRightWrongPos until created (and solved)
#3) Iterate through 
#4) Do guesses Remaining 
#5) End Game condition

def main():
    #takes the random number and assigns it to chosenNum
    chosenNum = setNumber()
    print(chosenNum)

    # get user's guess
    usrGuess = getGuess()

    #checks for win upon guess
    if (chosenNum == usrGuess):
        print("You WIN!")
        print("The correct answer was: ", chosenNum)

def setNumber():
    #picks a random number between 0 and 9999
    number = randrange(0, 10000)
    #sets the number to a string
    ret = str(number)
    #returns the string & if < 4 will add 0 to the front until it is 4 
    return ret.zfill(4)

def getGuess():
    #gets the user guess
    
    usrGuess = input("Enter a Guess: ")
        
    return usrGuess
    
def checkForPosAndRight(usrGuess, chosenNum):
    #need to create this still
    for index in range(len(numberList))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
{% endhighlight %}

Just checking - you know those aren't valid documentation comments, right? I'm totally okay with you cleaning them up later. As long as you know.

Just checking - you know this review is done like a normal one but you don't owe this project to me to keep me willing to teach you, right? This is a problem you can let go of if you decide to.
