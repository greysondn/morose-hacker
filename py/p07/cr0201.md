<a name="pr07cr0201-fix-"></a>Variable Naming Conventions
=========================================================

I had assumed that variable naming conventions were already well established with you; that was a mistake I should be blamed for. Nevertheless, I do have to go over them, so consider this a replacement for what would have been part of Lesson 02 originally.

Line 23, you name a string var `A_Z`  
Line 24, you name a string var `A_Z13`  
Line 25, you name a string var `In`  
Line 26, you name a string var `Out`  
Line 29, you name an iter var `cha`  
Line 30, you name an int var `hold`  
Line 32, you name an string var `hold2`

Just so we have a clear list to refer to. And with the caveat that they must be vars because this is Python (which may give some breathing room we'll cover directly).

Variable naming conventions are the following, and this is true of most languages nowadays (older code has other properties):

* Variable names must
    * start with a capital letter, lower case letter, or underscore
    * contain only letters, underscores, and numbers
    * not conflict with a builtin identifier or keyword
* Variable names - in general - should
    * not start with a capital letter, or be in all capitals
    * not start with an underscore
    * make use of camelCase - the words should be smushed together, with each new word resulting in a capital letter. `thisWayAnEntireSentenceCanBeReadable`.
    * be semantically clear - that is, variable names should reflect what they are, in the context of the program.
* Variable names - in python - should
    * Not start with an underscore, or two underscores, unless the metasyntactic implications are known and intended. (If that flew over your head, you don't know or intend them, and they're on the long list of things to learn.)
    * Not end with an underscore, or two underscores, as this can be confused easily with metasyntactic indicators or, in some cases, trigger metasyntactic properties. (Again, same reason.)

Python in general has no concept of `constants` - a variable type that is declared at compilation time and impossible to change during execution. Constants in python, however, do follow traditional rules, with the caveat that *programmers observe the rules, instead of the interpreter*. Thus names have a specific meaning.

* Constant names must
    * start with a capital letter, lower case letter, or underscore
    * contain only letters, underscores, and numbers
    * not conflict with a builtin identifier or keyword
* Constant names - in general - should
    * Be in ALL CAPITALS, with the exception of numbers and underscores.
    * Separate individual words with an underscore.

There is a significance to what would otherwise be a variable name starting with a capital; as such it's bad form. We will get to this "soon", but what you need to know is that typically that's how classes and other object-oriented structures are typically named (interfaces, abstracts, etc). In other words, variables aren't typically started with a capital letter, at all, because it can be confusing when looking to differentiate between a variable and a class.

Classes are part of lesson 14-ish. (It's not written yet. Sorry.)

With this all in hand, we can evaluate usage one at a time of these.

* Line 23 - string var `A_Z`
  * Never changes, so a case could be made that you named it for intent to be used as a constant, which would mean it follows constant conventions properly
  * Is named semantically, in the sense that it's the letters from `a` to `z`.
* Line 24 - string var `A_Z13`
  * Never changes, so a case could be made that you named it for intent to be used as a constant, which would mean it follows constant conventions properly
  * Is named semantically, in the sense that it's the letters from `a` to `z` shifted by 13 spaces.
* Line 25 - string var `In`
  * is either a var or a constant, so the name is bad form
  * changes during the execution of the program, therefore is a variable
  * is a variable, so it must be lowercase
  * however, when you name this lowercase, it conflicts with builtin keyword `in`, as in `for x in y`.
    * The solution was not to capitalize it. The solution was to pick another name. `userInput` would have worked fine. If we can't spare a few bytes to make a proper, clear name, we're failing at worse things than Python code.
* Line 26 - string var `Out`
  * is either a var or a constant, so the name is bad form.
  * changes during the execution of the program, therefore is a variable
  * is a variable, so it must be lowercase, as in `out`.
  * presumably you named this to match `In`; however, `out` isn't a keyword conflict in the first place, let alone problems already mentioned with `In` as a variable name.
* Line 29 - iter var `cha`
  * must be a variable (used for an iterable)
  * is named properly, so good job team
  * is named semantically, at least in the sense it's a cha(r) in a string.
  * Let's talk about this for a moment. You may have picked this up off of me and not know the source of this. In many languages, you must declare the type of your variables, and the type is checked consistently against what you say. For example, you might say `int myVar = 3` in some langage, and that would always have to be an int. One of the types common in such languages is the `char`. Ideally we'd like the name `char` as short for `character`, but that doesn't work if it has a name conflict in the language, so it's been adopted by myself (and you'll find others) as `cha` instead for that purpose. Just a quirk that you'll see in people who write in multiple languages. If you'd like to adopt it, it's fine, and it's clear what your intention is and any programmer worth anything will realize that you mean `cha` for `character` because of the same reasons that I use it that way.
  * In case you got lost, you're fine, this one is named fine, no problems here.
* Line 30 - int var `hold`
  * is a variable, both by name and by the fact it changes during program execution
  * is named properly for a variable, so good job there!
  * has a name that's semantically dicey. I can't judge you for having intermittent swap variables - I often use `swp` for mine - but you need to try to choose semantically clear ones when you can. As to what would be semantically clear? ... I don't have a good idea here, I'm just trying to head a potential problem off at the pass.
  * this is fine but...
* Line 31 - int var `hold2`
  * is a variable both by name and by the fact that it changes during program execution
  * is named properly for a var, so good job there
  * has a name that increases the lack of clarity. One swap var is understable, but the more you have, the more it has to be decoded what each one means if you don't name them clearly. Here, the program is short, and it's easy to trace; as programs get longer, such names get worse.
  * Assignment (use of the `=` operator to assign a value to an identifier for a variable or otherwise) is right hand significant in Python. What this means is that everything to the right of the `=` sign gets ran before the assignment from right to left happens. One of the upshots of this - and the main reason for languages to do this - is that you can use a variable in its own assignment. So you could have just reused `hold` here.

With all these in hand, here is what you code would have looked like if you had followed these guidelines and advisories.

<a name="nameme1"></a>Grouping Code
===================================

Working with that version above...

Typically code is grouped into meaningful units via spacing, to help reading it quickly and clearly. This isn't an intuitive practice at all, but a few guidelines can be offered.

* When declaring variables early for scoping purposes, group them together near the top (which you've done).
* When performing certain tasks step by step, those steps go together, or in significant groupings if one step has substeps
  * This isn't clear and isn't always easy to determine. To me, your loop's body can all go together, without any newline spacing. Line 31 can go.
  * literally you'll just have to learn this via intuition and feeling it out. Sorry. I know it's not fun.
* When creating a loop or a logic chain, put a blank line both before and after the very start and very end.
  * This means a newline goes before the first if and after the end of the last else/elif.
  * This also means a newline goes before any line starting with `for` or `while`.
    * line 29, basically.

So now we get to here.

<a name="nameme2"></a>Pretty Printing
=====================================

... Working with the most recent iteration on your code provided here...

*Pretty printing* is the process of printing things in a human-friendly format to the terminal. In other words, in a way that humans can read easily. Sometimes it also means "not only easily readable, but also nice looking" (as in "actually pretty, not just the phrase")

Two major things I'd put forward to you are that questions and answers should be on different lines, and that after a user has given you input you should break a new line just to keep things grouped well.

It's customary for command line applications to start by breaking a single newline so that it's easy to see where the program was started compared to where it began running. Likewise, it's customary to exit with an extra newline so that there's a space before the next terminal command happens.

On prompt lines, make it clear to the user that there's a prompt. A right facing angled bracket - `>` - followed by a single space is typical of many interactive interfaces and will fit what a user expects well.

None of these things are *mandatory*. I will mention them over and over again to you, however, as they often make programs nicer and more usable.

Compare your program's output:

{% highlight text %}
$: python3 rollin.py
Enter a line to be converted: hello world
Your original phrase was: hello world
Your scrambled phrase is: uryyb jbeyq
{% endhighlight %}

To the sort of output I'm suggesting is this:

{% highlight text %}
$: python3 rollin.py

Enter a line to be converted:
--> hello world

Your original phrase was: hello world
Your scrambled phrase is: uryyb jbeyq
{% endhighlight %}

The code to do this reads like this:

<a name="nameme3"></a>Notes for Later
=====================================

Lines 1 to 20 have only succeeded in adding useless bulk to this review so that your line references stay as consistent as possible here. Please do not have such large leadins without good cause on a future date.

Further, those lines don't do me any good. I get you were keeping the notes you needed right next to your code. In the future, please remove notes that are purely for *your* benefit such as these lines from the code before submitting. (We're about to get into code documentation, and it will be extremely important what is in every line of your files.)

Comments remarking on what you're doing in the code, and - later on - documentation comments may stay. The gist here is that I don't need the notes for the assignment - you needed them. No other programmer is likely to need them if they just want to run your code that does a ROT13.

Remember that while I try not to be vicious, I cannot afford to hesitate to point out problems in reviewing your code. What may come off as abrasive and uncaring, or cold and calculated, is simply me reviewing the code. You are a good, bright person with potential; I am reviewing your code, not you.

Remember that the ways I suggest to do things are in line with what you know thus far (or expected to know thus far) and may not reflect best practices or what the ideal is. (And besides this, I only try to give the best way to do what you seem to want to do as long as it's sane; it's rare that problems have one exact solution.) On the bright side, if you follow them fairly consistently, they will reflect your level of experience and give a firm foundation to build on if anyone picks up where I left off.
